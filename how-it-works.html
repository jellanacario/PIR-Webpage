                First, be aware that everything emits an amount of IR radiation, 
                including people, animals, and even inanimate objects. The warmth 
                and material composition of the body or object affect how much IR 
                radiation they release. IR is invisible to humans, however, 
                electronic detecting tools that can pick up these signals have been 
                created. Thermal sensing applications, such as this project, use 
                passive infrared (PIR) sensors for motion detection.
            </p>

            <p>
                A pair of pyroelectric sensors are used by PIR sensors to identify 
                heat energy in the surrounding area. These two sensors are placed 
                next to one another, and the sensor will activate if the signal 
                difference between them changes. For example, a human who is a 
                possible intruder entering the room. That could imply that it sets 
                off an alert and warns homeowner. Each of the two pyroelectric sensors 
                is focused by IR radiation using a set of lenses that serve as the 
                housing for the sensor. The device's sensing area is expanded by these lenses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite that the lens configuration and sensor electronics involve advanced 
                technology, these devices are often used in practical settings. You only 
                need power and ground for the sensor to generate a discrete output powerful 
                enough for the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller to use and adjust how the PIR 
                engages after being triggered.
